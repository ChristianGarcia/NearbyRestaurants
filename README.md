NearbyRestaurants
=================

This is a solution for a test. It uses the [Google Places][1] API and the [Google Maps Android][2] API to show nearby restaurants.

The application consists of 2 screens:
1. A list of nearby restaurants within 1 mile radius
2. A map that shows the restaurants and their location.

The application can work offline, showing both in map and list screens all the restaurants (wether they fall into the 1 mile radius or not)
found so far.
